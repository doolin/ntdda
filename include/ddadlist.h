/* Doubly linked lists:  These are routines that you can use to create, use,
   and manipulate doubly linked lists.  Each list is made of Dlist structures.
   The first one is a "sentinel".  In other words, it holds nothing but points
   to the first and last elements in the list proper.  Sentinels are used
   to make programming easier - in this case, it makes deleting elements, and
   dealing with empty lists much easier.


   Dlist l, tmp;

   l = make_dl();

   When you call make_dl(), an empty list is returned.  This list has
   one Dlist element:  the sentinel.  The "flink" and "blink" pointers
   point to itself, and the "val" pointer is null.

   If you want to insert the two strings "1" and "2" into this list
   (suppose the list is in the variable l), you do the following

   dl_insert_b(l, "1");
   dl_insert_b(l, "2");

   Now, the list looks as follows:

   l --> |-------|   |-------|   |-------|
-------->| flink |-->| flink |-->| flink |-------
---------| blink |<--| blink |<--| blink |<------
         | val=0 |   |  val  |   |  val  |
         |-------|   |---|---|   |---|---|
                         |           |
                          \           \
                           --> "1"     --> "2"
    
   Suppose we want to print out the list.  Then we could do the
   following:

   for (tmp = l->flink; tmp != l; tmp = tmp->flink) {
     printf("%s\n", tmp->val);
   }

   Note how having a sentinel element makes life easier.  If the 
   list is empty, the loop works perfectly.  In this header file,
   there is a macro defined:  dl_traverse.  Look at it and make 
   sure you know how it works.  The above loop can be rewritten using
   dl_traverse:

   dl_traverse(tmp, l) printf("%s\n", tmp->val);

   The following will also work:

   dl_traverse(tmp, l) {
     printf("%s\n", tmp->val);
   }
