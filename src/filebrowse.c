 * Function provides a common file broswer interface for dealing 
 * with variable types of input and output files in DDA.  This 
 * set of code was duplicated 4 times in the main dda.c file.
 * It is also being used to extend the capabilities of dda.  For 
 * instance, any valid results file generated from any dda source,
 * can be animated.  Results files from previous problems can be 
 * saved, so that it won't be necessary to rerun the problem to 
 * view that results.
