 * Revision 1.41  2002/10/25 01:53:36  doolin
 * Lots more clean up.  Some calling conventions changed.
 * Some dead or nearly code removed.  This commit is Not Yet Ready
 * For Prime Time.
 *
 * Revision 1.40  2002/10/24 15:12:35  doolin
 * Point commit to allow some unit testing on unix side.
 * (Much easier to write command line cod ein unix etc.)  Lots and
 * lots of relatively small changes, but the code has been touched
 * almost everywhere.  Probably should not update on this commit.
 * Wait until a future commit.
 *
 * Revision 1.39  2002/10/22 15:35:20  doolin
 * minor cleanups
 *
 * Revision 1.38  2002/10/21 14:53:55  doolin
 * Updating callbacks now implemented.  No more
 * switching on rotation types every time somethings position
 * is updated.  Update function chosen once, then passed around.
 * This commit should still be usable by everyone.
 *
 * Revision 1.37  2002/10/21 03:18:11  doolin
 * All the computeDisplacement calls have been changed
 * so that the T map is now built using whatever callback is passed
 * into the function that needs to make a T map.  The function itself
 * is renamed transplacement_linear because that's what it is.  This
 * will allow changing to any arbitrary transplacement function in the
 * (near) future.  Specification is currently done in the function
 * that controls the analysis, and could be set using a flag or switch
 * later.  This set of commits is good, everyone should cvs update
 * as soon as possible, use the date if necessary.
 *
 * Revision 1.36  2002/10/14 16:02:47  doolin
 * Lots of small clean up done.  No major changes in this commit.
 *
 * Revision 1.35  2002/10/13 20:36:04  doolin
 * .
 *
 * Revision 1.34  2002/10/11 22:04:43  doolin
 * Mostly small stuff.
 *
 * Revision 1.33  2002/10/11 15:44:45  doolin
 * More componentization.  Still having difficulty
 * finding a convenient level of abstraction for stresses.
 * Transplacements have been delivered as callbacks to certain
 * components (e.g., stresses) to make it easier to test.
 *
 * Overall, the API complexity is increasing a bit as derived
 * types are being replaced with primitives, but it is making it
 * much easier to write testing code.
 *
 * Revision 1.32  2002/10/10 15:05:31  doolin
 * More tests for stress.
 *
 * Revision 1.31  2002/10/09 01:46:39  doolin
 * Lots of clean up and fix it work on this commit.
 * Details are in the diffs  ;)
 *
 * Revision 1.30  2002/10/05 22:36:24  doolin
 * Cleaned up rock bolt material handling.  Bolt
 * materials are now incomplete types, and accessed through the
 * bolt API.  Bolt array initialization was rewritten to allow
 * adding arbitrary elements to the bolt array without messing
 * up memory.  Now there is a single allocator that should be used.
 * Derived algorithm for handling pretensioning (which is really
 * just rolling over stepwise force changes), but it is not
 * completely implemented yet.
 *
 * Revision 1.29  2002/09/07 00:26:59  doolin
 * changed output to support Kat & Meagan's studies.  Modified postprocessing to write bolt endpoints to .m and .log files (matlab and excel formats), and block vertices to .m and .log files.
 * Default is to write block vertices for all blocks containing measured points, but "all" flag can be used to write vertices of all blocks.
 *
 * Revision 1.28  2002/08/03 14:42:29  doolin
 * More cleanup.  Read diffs for details.
 *
 * Revision 1.27  2002/07/22 19:02:34  doolin
 * 3 changes: 1) with "showorig" activated, original bolt positions are drawn in solid black.  2) bolts 2-n no longer fall out of the blocks.  3) bolt stiffness now affects the results.
 *
 * Revision 1.26  2002/06/23 16:57:17  doolin
 *
 * * Some API changes to move back towards passing primitives
 *   as function arguments whenever possible.  This makes it
 *   much easier to write test cases because the entire DDA
 *   framework is not needed.
 *
 * * Restoring the stiffness and forcing matrices was moved
 *   from df24() into the main analysis loop to create symmetry
 *   with the saveState() function.  OCI works from the original
 *   state of these matrices, which are both overwritten during
 *   solution of the linear system.  There is probably a better
 *   way to do this.
 *
 * Revision 1.25  2002/05/26 23:47:24  doolin
 * Large amounts of cleanup and some redundant code
 * removed.
 *
 * Revision 1.24  2002/05/26 15:56:05  doolin
 * Status bar handling is vastly improved, ready and
 * geometry states now unified.  Next, unify with analysis status,
 * then define a callback framework to shorten the code by half.
 *
 * Revision 1.23  2002/05/25 14:49:40  doolin
 * Many changes in gui and file handling code to help
 * ease memory management and control of flow problems.
 * Callback framework for event handlers started.
 *
 * Revision 1.22  2002/05/19 16:43:02  doolin
 * More general source cleanup.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  2002/05/19 00:08:42  doolin
 *
 * Current check out does not build for some reason.
 * Hopefully this update will fix that.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  2001/12/29 06:01:05  doolin
 * If this commit breaks anything, check out any revision before
 * Christmas.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  2001/11/09 14:41:30  doolin
 * The penalty code in df18 does not work correctly.  Backporting
 * ghs original penalty code doesn't work anymore, the logic is too far apart.
 * The current code will have to be hand checked with ghs original code, in lieu
 * having a correct, formally specified penalty algortihm.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2001/11/05 02:59:49  doolin
 * Unit weights now set from density.  Showstopper bug in
 * open-close, not clear what the problem is.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2001/11/02 13:38:41  doolin
 * Gravitational acceleration now a user option, specifically to
 * allow zero gravity.  Not sure if the tag has any effect at the moment,
 * because setting density to zero blows up the code while setting unit mass to zero works fine.  Having unit mass non zero doesn't work.  The code should not blow up for zero density, this is a bug.  Also, having both density and unit
 * mass specified should not be allowed.  Specify one or the other, but not both.  This will be enforced soon.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2001/09/15 14:14:35  doolin
 * This has been a very long week.  It is hard to recall exactly
 * what was done last weekend, after the events on Tues. Sept. 11 2001, and
 * hard to really care.   At the minimum, TCKs 1995 contact damping has been
 * *fully* implemented, from the code in the forcing vector to the requisite
 * DDAML file handling changes.  As usual, there is not a clear (to me) way
 * of checking the correctness of the code other than single stepping through
 * and checking values.  This has _not_ yet been done.  The contact
 * damping code is only in the development version, and will not be released
 * in the next release version.  There will probably be a couple more commits
 * after this (small) as the rest of last weeks changes come to light.  Also,
 * changes made in the release branch are still propagating into the dev
 * branch, which is ugly and will have to be fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2001/09/03 03:45:37  doolin
 * REALLY IMPORTANT:  This set of commits will be
 * tagged, then version 1.6 release candidate 1 will be branched
 * from the main code.  Development will then proceed in parallel
 * between the development version and the release version.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2001/08/26 00:21:21  doolin
 * Major output format change for block areas to handle all
 * the moments for each block at each time step.  The downside of this is
 * that the output file will require more postprocessing, which can be
 * trivially handled in matlab, octave or a simple perl script, etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2001/08/24 22:56:23  doolin
 * Started work on abstracting data output code to
 * make it easier to handle different types of output data
 * depending on the geometry and the analysis file.  This will be
 * tedious because of the messy code interfacing windows to the
 * numerical back end.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/07/23 12:54:49  doolin
 * Added stuff to the contact handling code.
 * The whole build is broken, don't know why.  Examples don't
 * work correctly, and they run very slowly.  Will probably
 * need to back out several weeks, possibly months worth of
 * changes to figure it out.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2001/07/15 00:04:30  doolin
 * Minor changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2001/07/14 23:13:44  doolin
 * Added a contact unit test, more comments in open close fns.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2001/07/14 15:39:37  doolin
 * Worked in df18 and df22 on contact and locking.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2001/07/01 22:43:54  doolin
 * Rewrote the logic in the getLockStates function.
 * The previous logic is saved in the getLockStatesOld function.
 * All this needs to be verified against the original code.  If there
 * is a big screw up, just use the original function, and-or back out
 * the changes from cvs using revision numbers.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/07/01 20:37:56  doolin
 * Changed dimension on the locks matrix QQ in df18.
 * Note the revision number of this carefully, because these
 * changes may need to be backed out.
