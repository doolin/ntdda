 * $Log: combineddf.c,v $
 * Revision 1.19  2001/11/09 14:41:30  doolin
 * The penalty code in df18 does not work correctly.  Backporting
 * ghs original penalty code doesn't work anymore, the logic is too far apart.
 * The current code will have to be hand checked with ghs original code, in lieu
 * having a correct, formally specified penalty algortihm.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2001/11/05 02:59:49  doolin
 * Unit weights now set from density.  Showstopper bug in
 * open-close, not clear what the problem is.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2001/11/02 13:38:41  doolin
 * Gravitational acceleration now a user option, specifically to
 * allow zero gravity.  Not sure if the tag has any effect at the moment,
 * because setting density to zero blows up the code while setting unit mass to zero works fine.  Having unit mass non zero doesn't work.  The code should not blow up for zero density, this is a bug.  Also, having both density and unit
 * mass specified should not be allowed.  Specify one or the other, but not both.  This will be enforced soon.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2001/09/15 14:14:35  doolin
 * This has been a very long week.  It is hard to recall exactly
 * what was done last weekend, after the events on Tues. Sept. 11 2001, and
 * hard to really care.   At the minimum, TCKs 1995 contact damping has been
 * *fully* implemented, from the code in the forcing vector to the requisite
 * DDAML file handling changes.  As usual, there is not a clear (to me) way
 * of checking the correctness of the code other than single stepping through
 * and checking values.  This has _not_ yet been done.  The contact
 * damping code is only in the development version, and will not be released
 * in the next release version.  There will probably be a couple more commits
 * after this (small) as the rest of last weeks changes come to light.  Also,
 * changes made in the release branch are still propagating into the dev
 * branch, which is ugly and will have to be fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2001/09/03 03:45:37  doolin
 * REALLY IMPORTANT:  This set of commits will be
 * tagged, then version 1.6 release candidate 1 will be branched
 * from the main code.  Development will then proceed in parallel
 * between the development version and the release version.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2001/08/26 00:21:21  doolin
 * Major output format change for block areas to handle all
 * the moments for each block at each time step.  The downside of this is
 * that the output file will require more postprocessing, which can be
 * trivially handled in matlab, octave or a simple perl script, etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2001/08/24 22:56:23  doolin
 * Started work on abstracting data output code to
 * make it easier to handle different types of output data
 * depending on the geometry and the analysis file.  This will be
 * tedious because of the messy code interfacing windows to the
 * numerical back end.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/07/23 12:54:49  doolin
 * Added stuff to the contact handling code.
 * The whole build is broken, don't know why.  Examples don't
 * work correctly, and they run very slowly.  Will probably
 * need to back out several weeks, possibly months worth of
 * changes to figure it out.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2001/07/15 00:04:30  doolin
 * Minor changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2001/07/14 23:13:44  doolin
 * Added a contact unit test, more comments in open close fns.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2001/07/14 15:39:37  doolin
 * Worked in df18 and df22 on contact and locking.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2001/07/01 22:43:54  doolin
 * Rewrote the logic in the getLockStates function.
 * The previous logic is saved in the getLockStatesOld function.
 * All this needs to be verified against the original code.  If there
 * is a big screw up, just use the original function, and-or back out
 * the changes from cvs using revision numbers.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/07/01 20:37:56  doolin
 * Changed dimension on the locks matrix QQ in df18.
 * Note the revision number of this carefully, because these
 * changes may need to be backed out.
