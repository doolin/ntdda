 * Drives the dda forward analysis. The functions

 * functions from the "df", or "dda forward" 
 * written by GHS.
 * 
 * $Log: analysisdriver.c,v $
 * Revision 1.15  2002/05/25 14:49:40  doolin
 * Many changes in gui and file handling code to help
 * ease memory management and control of flow problems.
 * Callback framework for event handlers started.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2002/05/19 16:43:02  doolin
 * More general source cleanup.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2001/11/02 13:38:41  doolin
 * Gravitational acceleration now a user option, specifically to
 * allow zero gravity.  Not sure if the tag has any effect at the moment,
 * because setting density to zero blows up the code while setting unit mass to zero works fine.  Having unit mass non zero doesn't work.  The code should not blow up for zero density, this is a bug.  Also, having both density and unit
 * mass specified should not be allowed.  Specify one or the other, but not both.  This will be enforced soon.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/09/15 14:14:34  doolin
 * This has been a very long week.  It is hard to recall exactly
 * what was done last weekend, after the events on Tues. Sept. 11 2001, and
 * hard to really care.   At the minimum, TCKs 1995 contact damping has been
 * *fully* implemented, from the code in the forcing vector to the requisite
 * DDAML file handling changes.  As usual, there is not a clear (to me) way
 * of checking the correctness of the code other than single stepping through
 * and checking values.  This has _not_ yet been done.  The contact
 * damping code is only in the development version, and will not be released
 * in the next release version.  There will probably be a couple more commits
 * after this (small) as the rest of last weeks changes come to light.  Also,
 * changes made in the release branch are still propagating into the dev
 * branch, which is ugly and will have to be fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2001/09/03 03:45:37  doolin
 * REALLY IMPORTANT:  This set of commits will be
 * tagged, then version 1.6 release candidate 1 will be branched
 * from the main code.  Development will then proceed in parallel
 * between the development version and the release version.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2001/08/26 03:16:26  doolin
 * One extern out, 2 more to go.  Lots of small API argument
 * changes.  Also, the formerly externally declared var was a struct,
 * so we are now leaking sizeof(Geometrydata) for each geometry, possibly
 * for each run.  This will be dealt with from the console after all the
 * externs are done.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2001/08/26 02:15:49  doolin
 * Some minor changes leading up to a major memory overhaul to eliminate externs.  
 * This commit will be tagged as 1.5.126
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2001/08/26 00:21:20  doolin
 * Major output format change for block areas to handle all
 * the moments for each block at each time step.  The downside of this is
 * that the output file will require more postprocessing, which can be
 * trivially handled in matlab, octave or a simple perl script, etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/08/24 22:56:22  doolin
 * Started work on abstracting data output code to
 * make it easier to handle different types of output data
 * depending on the geometry and the analysis file.  This will be
 * tedious because of the messy code interfacing windows to the
 * numerical back end.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2001/08/17 03:29:19  doolin
 * Found a bug in namespace handling for geometry files.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/07/23 12:54:49  doolin
 * Added stuff to the contact handling code.
 * The whole build is broken, don't know why.  Examples don't
 * work correctly, and they run very slowly.  Will probably
 * need to back out several weeks, possibly months worth of
 * changes to figure it out.
