 * Drives the dda forward analysis. The functions
 * invoked from this driver comprise the set of 
 * functions from the "df", or "dda forward" 
 * written by GHS.
 * 
 * $Log: analysisdriver.c,v $
 * Revision 1.23  2002/09/07 00:26:59  doolin
 * changed output to support Kat & Meagan's studies.  Modified postprocessing to write bolt endpoints to .m and .log files (matlab and excel formats), and block vertices to .m and .log files.
 * Default is to write block vertices for all blocks containing measured points, but "all" flag can be used to write vertices of all blocks.
 *
 * Revision 1.22  2002/08/03 14:42:29  doolin
 * More cleanup.  Read diffs for details.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  2002/06/23 16:57:17  doolin
 *
 * * Some API changes to move back towards passing primitives
 *   as function arguments whenever possible.  This makes it
 *   much easier to write test cases because the entire DDA
 *   framework is not needed.
 *
 * * Restoring the stiffness and forcing matrices was moved
 *   from df24() into the main analysis loop to create symmetry
 *   with the saveState() function.  OCI works from the original
 *   state of these matrices, which are both overwritten during
 *   solution of the linear system.  There is probably a better
 *   way to do this.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  2002/06/07 15:09:42  doolin
 * Moved loadpoints into a module, started unit
 * tests for loadpoints.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  2002/05/27 15:23:56  doolin
 * * More general hardening of user space.
 *
 * * Started cleaning up ddaml handling code.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  2002/05/26 23:47:24  doolin
 * Large amounts of cleanup and some redundant code
 * removed.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2002/05/26 15:56:05  doolin
 * Status bar handling is vastly improved, ready and
 * geometry states now unified.  Next, unify with analysis status,
 * then define a callback framework to shorten the code by half.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2002/05/26 01:16:07  doolin
 * Moved geometry allocation code, cleaned up
 * time history code.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2002/05/25 14:49:40  doolin
 * Many changes in gui and file handling code to help
 * ease memory management and control of flow problems.
 * Callback framework for event handlers started.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2002/05/19 16:43:02  doolin
 * More general source cleanup.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2001/11/02 13:38:41  doolin
 * Gravitational acceleration now a user option, specifically to
 * allow zero gravity.  Not sure if the tag has any effect at the moment,
 * because setting density to zero blows up the code while setting unit mass to zero works fine.  Having unit mass non zero doesn't work.  The code should not blow up for zero density, this is a bug.  Also, having both density and unit
 * mass specified should not be allowed.  Specify one or the other, but not both.  This will be enforced soon.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2001/09/15 14:14:34  doolin
 * This has been a very long week.  It is hard to recall exactly
 * what was done last weekend, after the events on Tues. Sept. 11 2001, and
 * hard to really care.   At the minimum, TCKs 1995 contact damping has been
 * *fully* implemented, from the code in the forcing vector to the requisite
 * DDAML file handling changes.  As usual, there is not a clear (to me) way
 * of checking the correctness of the code other than single stepping through
 * and checking values.  This has _not_ yet been done.  The contact
 * damping code is only in the development version, and will not be released
 * in the next release version.  There will probably be a couple more commits
 * after this (small) as the rest of last weeks changes come to light.  Also,
 * changes made in the release branch are still propagating into the dev
 * branch, which is ugly and will have to be fixed.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2001/09/03 03:45:37  doolin
 * REALLY IMPORTANT:  This set of commits will be
 * tagged, then version 1.6 release candidate 1 will be branched
 * from the main code.  Development will then proceed in parallel
 * between the development version and the release version.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2001/08/26 03:16:26  doolin
 * One extern out, 2 more to go.  Lots of small API argument
 * changes.  Also, the formerly externally declared var was a struct,
 * so we are now leaking sizeof(Geometrydata) for each geometry, possibly
 * for each run.  This will be dealt with from the console after all the
 * externs are done.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2001/08/26 02:15:49  doolin
 * Some minor changes leading up to a major memory overhaul to eliminate externs.  
 * This commit will be tagged as 1.5.126
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2001/08/26 00:21:20  doolin
 * Major output format change for block areas to handle all
 * the moments for each block at each time step.  The downside of this is
 * that the output file will require more postprocessing, which can be
 * trivially handled in matlab, octave or a simple perl script, etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/08/24 22:56:22  doolin
 * Started work on abstracting data output code to
 * make it easier to handle different types of output data
 * depending on the geometry and the analysis file.  This will be
 * tedious because of the messy code interfacing windows to the
 * numerical back end.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2001/08/17 03:29:19  doolin
 * Found a bug in namespace handling for geometry files.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/07/23 12:54:49  doolin
 * Added stuff to the contact handling code.
 * The whole build is broken, don't know why.  Examples don't
 * work correctly, and they run very slowly.  Will probably
 * need to back out several weeks, possibly months worth of
 * changes to figure it out.
