 * $Log: analysisdriver.c,v $
 * Revision 1.9  2001/08/26 02:15:49  doolin
 * Some minor changes leading up to a major memory overhaul to eliminate externs.  This commit will be tagged as 1.5.126
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2001/08/26 00:21:20  doolin
 * Major output format change for block areas to handle all
 * the moments for each block at each time step.  The downside of this is
 * that the output file will require more postprocessing, which can be
 * trivially handled in matlab, octave or a simple perl script, etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2001/08/24 22:56:22  doolin
 * Started work on abstracting data output code to
 * make it easier to handle different types of output data
 * depending on the geometry and the analysis file.  This will be
 * tedious because of the messy code interfacing windows to the
 * numerical back end.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2001/08/17 03:29:19  doolin
 * Found a bug in namespace handling for geometry files.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/07/23 12:54:49  doolin
 * Added stuff to the contact handling code.
 * The whole build is broken, don't know why.  Examples don't
 * work correctly, and they run very slowly.  Will probably
 * need to back out several weeks, possibly months worth of
 * changes to figure it out.
