deformation flow analysis using the distinct element method. 
The fracture system was modeled as a collection of pipes 
enclosed by rigid, non-deformable blocks.  The fracture
apertures, but not the fracture length or location were allowed
to vary over time.  A weakness of the model allowed blocks 
to overlap.  This model is probably not useful for slope
stability problems.},

comment ={MacLaughlin extended the basic {DDA} 
formulation by: (1) incorporating more accurate rigid body rotations;
(2) incorporating plane strain boundary conditions; (3) implementing
a gravity turn-on phase, and (4) deriving  a procedure for increasing the 
accuracy of contact forces.
%
MacLaughlin also compared DDA results with the analytical solutions
for a single block sliding on an inclined plane, two or more
 blocks on a biplanar failure surface, and blocks on a circular 
failure surface. DDA matched the analytic results well for 
the single block model, but multiple block models were found to be
analytically overconservative.},

pages	={96-108},
year	=1993,
comment ={In a set of companion papers, 
Wang and Garga and Garga and Wang 
develop an apparently independent 
block system model identical to Shi's DDA.   
They use the model to investigate rock bolts and pore
water pressure effects on excavations in blocky rock masses,
reporting good agreements with observed field behavior.
Their pore pressure formulation is static, and the block
system does not support isolated blocks (i.e. ``free fall'').
As of this paper,
Wang's method appears to be relatively simple.  It handles kinematic
instabilities and pore pressure.  The model is limited to rigid,
undeformable blocks, does not handle free-fall of blocks, assumes a
linear rotation angle without explaining the implicit assumtion that
the rotations are small.},

author= {M-C. R. Yeung},
title= {Application of Shi's Discontinuous Deformation 
Analysis to the Study of Rock Behavior},
school = {University of California, Berkeley},
year=1991,
comment ={Yeung investigated the mechanics of a 
single block on an incline, numerically solved an equation of 
motion for a thre hinged beam and investigated rock bolt 
interaction in mine roofs.  The single block model showed that 
dynamic equilibrium should be considered in the mode of behavior
of a block system, that is, whether sliding or sliding and 
toppling occur.  The three hinged beam problem showed that 
DDA can be dependent on the size of the time step, larger time
steps proved unconservative.  },
